## Der Vortrag

**Introduction to Knative**
(_Matthias Wessendorf_):
Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform that comes with a set of building blocks to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. Knative consists of three major areas: Build, Serving and Eventing. The session gives you an introduction of the different parts of Knative and walks you through an end-to-end demo, showing the lifecycle of an event-driven application. You will learn how to build container images inside your cluster, straight from your Git repository. The session explains how Knative uses Kubernetes and Istio features to provide request driven compute, so that services can autoscale, including down to 0, depending on the actual throughput. Finally you'll see integration of events and how your application can be hooked up to a firehose and connect your service to process incoming events. If you are interested in learning about serverless developer experience on Kubernetes, this session is for you!

**Developing and running Kafka based applications on Kubernetes**  
(_Jakub Scholz_):
Apache Kafka is one of the most popular platforms for streaming and messaging. This talk will show how easy it is to deploy and use Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and OpenShift using the open source project called Strimzi. Kubernetes operators provided by Strimzi let users deploy Apache Kafka with just few YAML files. It will also demonstrate how you can easily connect to Kafka and Strimzi from your own applications in a secure fashion using authentication and authorisation. The demo used during this talk will include several applications using different Apache Kafka components such as Kafka Connect or Kafka Streams and demonstrate the architecture patterns commonly used with Apache Kafka.
