## The Talk
**Asynchronous Programming in Java using Virtual Threads**

(_Dr. Venkat Subramaniam_):
Threads have been part of Java since the beginning. But, the new virtual threads, introduced as prerelease in Java 19, are different in how they're implemented and how we can benefit from them. In this presentation we will learn about virtual threads, the problems they solve, and how to make use of them.
